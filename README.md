# CNN
This is a CNN image classification problem on intel image dataset . We have to classify images in six classes - Street , Mountains , Sea , Glaciers , Building , Forest .
The dataset can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification# .
I have first tried a basic model . The model was overfitting. Then I handled the overfitting with two tenchniques. Dropout and Data Augmentation. I have found 80 % accuracy in the validation set.
